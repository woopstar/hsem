## Derived from the Huawei Solar Battery Optimization Project

This integration was inspired by and derived from the [Huawei Solar Battery Optimization Project](https://github.com/heinoskov/huawei-solar-battery-optimizations), which was developed to optimize battery usage and maximize self-consumption in solar systems. While that project focuses on managing Huawei solar batteries, this integration adapts the smoothing techniques from it to handle any type of fluctuating sensor data, whether related to energy or other measurements.

## Summary

The **Huawei Solar Energy Management (HSEM)** integration is a comprehensive solution designed to elevate the intelligence and efficiency of Huawei solar battery systems within Home Assistant. Inspired by the [Huawei Solar Battery Optimization Project](https://github.com/heinoskov/huawei-solar-battery-optimizations), this package not only maximizes energy self-consumption but also fine-tunes energy storage and grid interactions based on dynamic electricity prices, solar forecasting, and seasonal conditions.

HSEM employs advanced logic to align battery charging and discharging with real-time energy costs, TOU (Time-of-Use) schedules, and solar production forecasts. It actively prevents grid exports when unfavorable prices are detected and automatically shifts modes to prioritize self-consumption or TOU management. During the winter months, HSEM optimizes battery charging to fill to a SOC (State of Charge) cutoff threshold during the most cost-effective hours, while in warmer seasons, it maximizes self-consumption to make the most of solar production.

Key benefits include:

- **Cost-Efficient Energy Management**: Seamlessly aligns battery and grid interactions with real-time pricing, maximizing savings on energy costs.
- **Enhanced EV Charging Strategy**: Automatically adapts TOU schedules and discharge prevention while charging EVs, ensuring optimized use of solar and off-peak rates.
- **Seasonal Adjustments**: Automatically switches between TOU and Maximize Self Consumption (MSC) modes based on solar production and seasonal needs, enabling an intelligent response to changing daylight and weather patterns.
- **Winter-Specific Charging Optimization**: For colder months, charges the battery in the lowest-cost periods overnight and mid-day, ensuring the battery is optimally charged for high demand and peak periods.
- **Solar-Driven Energy Independence**: Promotes solar self-sufficiency, enabling homes to leverage their solar investment while contributing to a sustainable, low-carbon future.

Whether for tech-savvy homeowners or sustainability-focused users, the HSEM integration is engineered to bring robust, automated control over solar energy, delivering enhanced autonomy, financial savings, and environmental impact.

Perfect for advanced Home Assistant users, this integration taps into Huawei solar capabilities to bring state-of-the-art energy management right to your home.
