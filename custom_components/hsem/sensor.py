    Set up HSEM sensors from a config entry.

    This function initializes various HSEM sensors based on the provided configuration entry.
    It extracts configuration parameters, creates a WorkingModeSensor, sets its attributes,

    to Home Assistant and stores a reference to the platform for handling unloads later.
