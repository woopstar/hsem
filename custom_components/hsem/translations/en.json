The system calculates the average consumption for each hour over 1, 3, 7, and 14 days. These averages are then weighted to provide a combined, weighted estimate. This approach helps to smooth out anomalies, such as unusually high consumption on a single day due to low prices, and provides a reliable prediction of your expected power usage in specific time intervals (e.g., between 16:00 and 17:00).",
